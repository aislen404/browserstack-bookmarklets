![BrowserStack Bookmarklets](http://i.imgur.com/8fGn2.png "BrowserStack Bookmarklets")

[BrowserStack](http://www.browserstack.com) is a service that provides cross-browser, cross-mobile testing to developers who need to test javascript and/or css. I thought it was so handy that I wanted to cut out some of the time I was spending with URLs and just get a set of bookmarks that let me call up a browser from the current site I was on. This is a complete set of browsers offered on this service. I'd like to say this tool lives up to their tagline.

> Create an easier workflow for cross-browser testing, by connecting testers directly to BrowserStack.

## Upgrade

Delete your BrowserStack bookmark folder then repeat the installation steps.

## Future

I might play with adding a bookmarklet for local development with POW.

I will continue to update this as Browserstack keeps adding and removing browsers, but it is my hope that someone with browser extension experience will draw some inspiration from this and make something that uses the Browserstack API.
